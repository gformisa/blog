# The call to create_table specifies how the articles table should be constructed. By default, the create_table method adds an id column as an auto-incrementing primary key.
# So the first record in the table will have an id of 1, the next record will have an id of 2, and so on.
# Inside the block for create_table, two columns are defined: title and body. These were added by the generator because we included them in our generate command (bin/rails generate model Article title:string body:text).
# On the last line of the block is a call to t.timestamps. This method defines two additional columns named created_at and updated_at.
# As we will see, Rails will manage these for us, setting the values when we create or update a model object.
